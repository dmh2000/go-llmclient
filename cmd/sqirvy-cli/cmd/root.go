	Long: `Sqirvy-cli is a command line tool to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs).
   - It provides a simple interface to send prompts to the LLM and receive responses
   - Sqirvy-cli commands receive prompt input from stdin, filenames and URLs. Output is sent to stdout.
   - This architecture makes it simple to pipe from stdin -> query -> stdout -> query -> stdout...
   - The output is determined by the command and the input prompt.
   - The "query" command is used to send an arbitrary query to the LLM.
   - The "plan" command is used to send a prompt to the LLM and receive a plan in response.
   - The "code" command is used to send a prompt to the LLM and receive source code in response.
   - The "review" command is used to send a prompt to the LLM and receive a code review in response.
   - Sqirvy-cli is designed to support terminal command pipelines.
