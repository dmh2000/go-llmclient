 **HOW ARE THE INITIAL EMBEDDINGS GENERATED?**


## Initial Embedding Generation

The initial embeddings for words or tokens are typically generated through a process that transforms discrete textual units into dense, continuous numerical vectors. For many modern Large Language Models (LLMs), this often begins with a tokenization step, where raw text is broken down into smaller units (words, subwords, or characters). Each unique token is then assigned a unique integer ID. These IDs are then mapped to a vector space. Initially, these vectors might be randomly initialized, especially when training a model from scratch without any prior knowledge.

However, a more common and effective approach, particularly for models that aren't trained entirely from the ground up on massive datasets, is to leverage pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText. These models learn dense vector representations by analyzing vast amounts of text data, where words that appear in similar contexts are mapped to similar vector spaces. When an LLM is being developed, these pre-trained embeddings can serve as an excellent starting point, providing a rich, semantically meaningful initialization for the token embeddings. During the LLM's own pre-training phase, these initial embeddings (whether random or pre-trained) are then continuously updated and refined through backpropagation as the model learns to predict the next token or fill in masked tokens, ultimately capturing highly nuanced semantic and syntactic relationships within the language.


 **WHAT DOES THE POSITIONAL ENCODING PHASE DO TO THE EMBEDDINGS?**


## Positional Encoding's Role

The Positional Encoding phase is crucial for Transformer-based models because, unlike recurrent neural networks, Transformers process all tokens in a sequence simultaneously and in parallel. This parallel processing means the model inherently loses the sequential order of words â€“ it doesn't know if "cat" comes before or after "dog" in a sentence, only that both words are present. Positional Encoding addresses this by injecting information about the relative or absolute position of each token into its corresponding embedding.

This is typically achieved by adding a "positional vector" to the initial token embedding. These positional vectors are not learned in the same way as token embeddings; instead, they are often generated using mathematical functions, such as sine and cosine waves of varying frequencies, which create a unique and deterministic pattern for each position in the sequence. By adding these positional encodings to the token embeddings, the resulting combined vector now carries both the semantic meaning of the word (from the token embedding) and its location within the sequence. This allows the Transformer's attention mechanisms to understand not just *what* words are present, but also *where* they are, which is vital for comprehending grammar, syntax, and the overall meaning of a sentence.


 **WHAT DOES THE ATTENTION PHASE DO?**


## The Attention Phase

The Attention phase is a cornerstone of Transformer architectures, fundamentally transforming how the model processes and understands input sequences. Its primary function is to allow the model to weigh the importance of different tokens in the input sequence when generating or processing a specific token. Instead of treating each word in isolation or relying solely on its immediate neighbors, attention enables the model to look at all other words in the sequence and decide which ones are most relevant for understanding the current word's meaning in context. This mechanism effectively creates a dynamic, context-aware representation for each token.

During this phase, for each token, the model computes three vectors: a "query" (Q), a "key" (K), and a "value" (V). The query vector represents the current token being processed, while the key and value vectors represent all other tokens in the sequence. The attention mechanism then calculates a similarity score between the query of the current token and the keys of all other tokens. These scores are then normalized (typically with a softmax function) to create a set of weights. Finally, these weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the value vectors from all other tokens. This weighted sum is then added to or combined with the current token's embedding, effectively enriching its representation with relevant contextual information from the entire sequence. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and complex relationships between words, which is crucial for tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering.


 **WHAT DOES THE FEED FORWARD NEURAL NETWORK PHASE DO?**


## The Feed Forward Neural Network Phase

Following the attention mechanism, each token's enriched embedding passes through a position-wise Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN). This phase is crucial for introducing non-linearity and allowing the model to process the information gathered by the attention layers in a more complex way. Unlike the attention mechanism, which operates across the entire sequence to establish relationships between tokens, the FFNN operates independently and identically on each token's representation. It's essentially a simple, fully connected neural network applied to each position in the sequence separately.

Typically, this FFNN consists of two linear transformations with a non-linear activation function (like ReLU) in between. Its primary role is to transform the output of the attention sub-layer into a higher-dimensional space and then project it back down, allowing the model to learn more intricate patterns and features from the contextualized embeddings. This independent processing for each token, while sharing the same FFNN parameters across all positions, enables the model to refine the token's representation further, capturing more abstract and higher-level features that are essential for understanding complex language structures and performing various downstream tasks.
