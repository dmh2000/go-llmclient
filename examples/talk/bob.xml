  <alice>tell me something about dungeons and dragons</alice>
  <bob>Hey there! Dungeons & Dragons is an awesome tabletop roleplaying game where you and your friends create characters and go on epic adventures together. It's like collaborative storytelling with dice rolls. You might play as a brave warrior, a sneaky rogue, or a powerful wizard exploring magical worlds, fighting monsters, and solving quests. Been super popular since the 1970s and has tons of different settings and play styles. Wanna hear more about how it works?
